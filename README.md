## Abstract

Statistical teaching often focuses on models and techniques, with much less
time devoted to emphasising the primacy of the real-world questions that these
are meant to answer.  One consequence is what we call the 'true model myth':
the belief that statistics is about finding the 'best' model or technique to
apply to the data.

To help students avoid this, we propose explicitly teaching the idea of
a 'statistical investigation', which would be rather like a scientific
investigation.  This starts with well-posed questions, to be investigated via
potentially several different analyses (analogous to scientific experiment),
with the results drawn together to form the final conclusions.

The examples we provide should reinforce this.  When we teach new techniques,
we often keep things simple and show only a single analysis.  We can remind
students of the larger story by replacing or supplementing these with examples
where multiple techniques are used.  We present several such examples and
exercises that would fit naturally within existing curricula.

Although this change might seem to complicate teaching, we expect that it will
actually lead to greater student satisfaction since students will develop
skills for "scaffolding" problems in the context of real-world questions.
